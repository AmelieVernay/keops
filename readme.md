libkp is a library which implements in Cuda various operations using kernels. It 
uses a "tiled implementation" in order to have a O(n) memory footprint instead 
of usual O(n^2) codes generating by high level libraries like Thrust, pyTorch or
TensorFlow... It comes with various examples ranging from lddmm (non rigid 
deformations) to kernel density estimations (non parametric statistics).  

For instance, the basic example is a Gaussian convolution (on a non regular grid):
```math
 \gamma_i =  \sum_j K(x_i,y_j) \beta_j
```
 where $`K(x_i,y_j) = exp(-|x_i - y_j|^2 / \sigma^2)`$.
 
The core of code is written in CUDA. We also provide bindings in python (numpy and pytorch complient),  matlab and R.


# Quick start

## Python user

Two steps:

1) Compilation of the cuda codes. The subdirectory `./python` contains a shell script `makefile.sh`. The user needs to custom the paths contained in this file.

2) Run the out-of-the-box working examples `./python/example/convolution.py`

3) If you are already familiar with the LDDMM theory and want ot get started quickly, please check the all-in-one script: `python/tutorials/lddmm/lddmm_pytorch.py`

## matlab user


## R user
