    "# Fitting a generative model using standard divergences between measures\n",
    "(Author: Jean Feydy; this notebook is not finished yet, as it lacks a LibKP backend.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how to tune the parameters of a generative model to match it with an empirical distribution.\n",
    "Having observed a sample $y_1, \\dots, y_M \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, we assume that the dataset was drawn according to an i.i.d. process of law $\\mu_{\\text{gen}} \\in \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ which models an unknown generative process.\n",
    "We represent the **target** empirical distribution as a probability measure\n",
    "$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_j \\delta_{y_j} = \\sum_j \\nu_j \\, \\delta_{y_j}.$$\n",
    "Generically, the training dataset is thus modeled as a **sum of weighted dirac masses** which samples an unknown probability measure $\\mu_{\\text{gen}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The density fitting problem.** Given this input distribution $\\nu$, we wish to extract its main features and, if possible, mimick it by generating \"plausible\" vectors $x_1, \\dots, x_N \\in \\mathbb{R^d}$; regressing $\\mu_{\\text{gen}}$ in an intelligent way. An obvious solution would be to draw samples from the finite set $\\{y_1, \\dots, y_M\\}$ with weights given by the $\\nu_j$'s...\n",
    "But this is not very satisfying. Intuitively, if the $y_j$'s were drawn according to a Gaussian distribution, we should be able to regress its mean and covariance matrix; not restrict ourselves to a finite sampling!\n",
    "Hence, **to give a relevant answer to a density estimation problem, we must introduce some prior**; assert that some probability measures (say, Gaussian laws) are much more likely to be \"the real underlying distribution $\\mu_{\\text{gen}}$\" than finite probability measures on some randomish point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An explicit cost to minimize.** Today, in line with a ``PyTorch``-friendly algorithmic paradigm, we choose to encode our prior in **the explicit structure of a generating program**.\n",
    "A deterministic application $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ (i.e. a vector-valued program) defines a natural pushforward action \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f\\# : \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{R}^d) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "such that sampling $f\\#\\mu_0$ is equivalent to applying $f$ to $\\mu_0$-samples.\n",
    "Hence, if $\\mu_0$ is a (simple) reference measure in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and if $(f_w)_{w\\in \\mathbb{R}^p}$\n",
    "is a family of deterministic functions mapping $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$\n",
    "parametrized by vectors $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$, we can **look for model densities $\\mu_w$ of the form**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu_w ~=~ f_w\\# \\mu_0  \\in \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{R}^d), ~~ \\text{which should be close to $\\mu_{\\text{gen}}$.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we restrict the search space to the model measures *that can be desribed using $f_w$*.\n",
    "To formulate a well-posed problem, all we need now is **a discrepancy (data attachment) formula $\\text{d}$,\n",
    "which quantifies how far away the model distribution $f_w \\# \\mu_0$ is to the target $\\nu$**.\n",
    "Assuming we have such a convenient formula at hand,\n",
    "we can then look for the optimal vector of parameters $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ that minimizes the real-valued cost\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Cost}(w) ~=~ \\text{d}( \\mu_w, \\nu ).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, a gradient-descent like \n",
    "scheme can converge towards a good-enough value $w^*$, and we use $\\mu_{w^*} = f_{w^*} \\# \\mu_0$\n",
    "as an estimate for the underlying distribution $\\mu_{\\text{gen}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan of this notebook.** The procedure described above can help us to *regress densities* by enforcing a strong generative prior... But we still have to work out the details! In the first part, we introduce the `PyTorch` syntax needed to encode a simple (polynomial) generative model for measures on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Then, we show how to implement three standard divergences $\\text{d}(\\mu_w, \\nu)$ between sampled measures:\n",
    "- The kernel distance $\\text{d}_k$, linked to the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces.\n",
    "- The log-likelihood score $\\text{d}_{\\text{ML}}$, related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of information theory.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've presented three major families of \"distance\" costs between probability measures:\n",
    "- Kernel distances (also known as *Maximum Mean Discrepancies*), which descend from dual norms on **Sobolev-like spaces of functions**.\n",
    "- Empirical log-likelihoods, which converge towards **Kullback-Leibler discrepancies**.\n",
    "- Sinkhorn distances, designed as cheap approximations of Optimal Transport costs; they can be linked to dual norms on **Lipschitz-like spaces of functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the three of them use **the same atomic operation: the Kernel Product**, possibly implemented in the log-domain. As it is a GPU-friendly operation, using these formulas results in scalable algorithm.\n",
    "But which one should we use in practical applications?\n",
    "This is the main question, that can only be answered with respect to specific applications and datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A rule of thumb:** kernel distances and log-likelihoods are both cheap, and differ in the way they handle **outliers** and isolated $x_i$'s or $y_j$'s. \n",
    "With kernel distances, they are nearly *forgotten* as the tail of the kernel function $k$ goes to zero;\n",
    "in the likelihood case, though, since $-\\log k(x) \\rightarrow +\\infty$ when $x$ grows, outliers tend to have a large influence on the overall cost and its gradient.\n",
    "More recently introduced, Sinkhorn distances tend to be both interpretable and robust... At a high computational cost. Computing a full transport plan to simply get a *gradient* is overkill for most applications, and future works will certainly focus on cheap approximations that interpolate between OT and simpler theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get your own intuition on the subject, feel free to re-run this notebook with different parameters' values!\n"
